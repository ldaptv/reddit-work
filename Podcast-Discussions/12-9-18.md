# Heroes Weekly Podcast Roundup - 12/9/18 thru 12/15/18

Welcome to the last weekly informative post for 2018 highlighting and summarizing audio podcast talk shows dedicated to discussing Heroes of the Storm.  HotS has a number of dedicated podcasts each week that discuss all aspects of the game.  Listening to podcasts is a great way to stay connected to discussions about HotS when you are away from the game, Discord, or Reddit.  If you are new to podcasts this [**(Link)**](https://www.wired.com/story/podcasts-beginners-guide/) provides a good overview for beginners and this [**(Link)**](https://www.listennotes.com/) is for a good podcast search engine.

It has been a pleasure to do these weekly "TV Guide" podcast roundup's for the HotS community, but they do take some effort to maintain the weekly summaries.  In 2019, I might continue the post without the summaries, but want to see how the recent HGC and HotS development news affects the community.

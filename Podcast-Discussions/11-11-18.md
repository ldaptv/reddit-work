# Heroes Weekly Podcast Roundup - 11/11/18 thru 11/17/18

Welcome to the weekly informative post highlighting and summarizing audio podcast talk shows dedicated to discussing Heroes of the Storm.  HotS has a number of dedicated podcasts each week that discuss all aspects of the game.  Listening to podcasts is a great way to stay connected to discussions about HotS when you are away from the game, Discord, or Reddit.  If you are new to podcasts this [**(Link)**](https://www.wired.com/story/podcasts-beginners-guide/) provides a good overview for beginners and this [**(Link)**](https://www.listennotes.com/) is for a good podcast search engine.

We are back after a brief vacation last week.  Please note that these post will end on December 17th, 2018 and there will be no post on November 26th, 2018, since many podcasts will probably be taking a quick holiday break.  It was my honor to create this list each week raising awareness of all the great content being produced by HotS fans.

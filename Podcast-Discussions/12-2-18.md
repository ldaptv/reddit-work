Welcome to the weekly informative post highlighting and summarizing audio podcast talk shows dedicated to discussing Heroes of the Storm.  HotS has a number of dedicated podcasts each week that discuss all aspects of the game.  Listening to podcasts is a great way to stay connected to discussions about HotS when you are away from the game, Discord, or Reddit.

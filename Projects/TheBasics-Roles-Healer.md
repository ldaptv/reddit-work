# The Basics - Roles: Healer

Welcome to the **Weekly Basic's Discussion** where this week we will feature a discussion about the role [Healer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRZmNMO5V1Q) that was defined in the new [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18/).  These discussions are targeted at those looking to learn or brush up on a roles core principles, common practices, and mistakes to avoid.
  
The **Healer Role** [**(Link)**](https://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/healer) is defined in the new role system as heroes that focus primarily on direct healing and damage mitigation.  Prior to the rework, healers were identified as "Supports" and as a result a number of articles that are referenced might refer to the role as support.
  
* **The Healer's Handbook by *u/ZeroMax1** - [**(Link)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145joZjb9bhyInwGMFKbGFeB6A5-uYRxVjQDO6eK8Nsg/edit) - Defines healing as four practices:

  * **Avoiding death** -  It is important for supports to skillfully avoid dying in order to be able to sustain the team.
  * **Good Positioning** - Supports should be positioning between the front and back lines, and always present for team fights.
  * **Managing Resources** - It is important for healers to manage their mana and cooldowns and use them only when appropriate.
  * **Executing Saves** - Many healers have abilities that can save a teammate from immediate death through skillful execution.  

* **Healing Videos*** - Illustrating the healing practices:

  * **HotS Healer Guide by *Lord Jaraxxus** - [**(Link)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqSN-fgF9xE)  
  * **Positioning Guide w/Nubkeks** - [**(Link)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DER26PYa558) 

* **What makes a Good Healer by *u/ZeroMax1*** - [**(Link)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/7gj03t/healers_handbook_special_on_hiatus_support_nerfs/) - Defines the following as important characteristics for healers:

  * **Balance between burst and sustain healing** - Healers that specialize in only one type of healing usually need a support to compensate.
  * **Some form of self-sustain** - Healers need to be able to heal themselves reliably.
  * **Utility** - Healers need some type of utility beside healing in order to be viable on the team.
  * **Escapes** - Healers need to be able to escape in some way if they are being focused by the enemy team.
  * **Mitigation** - Healers need to have some way to mitigate certain effects through the use of cleanses or other heroic abilities.

The New Player Guide wiki [**(Link)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/wiki/newplayerguide#wiki_support) features links to healer articles.  We plan to update the section with new content about the role rework as it develops and incorporate feedback from this discussion as well.

Greetings,

With the upcoming changes to ranked play, the [/r/heroesofthestorm](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm) moderators wonder if we are providing enough of a framework to the community for finding like minded folks to group up with in the new Storm League format.

A quick recap what we provide:

* Weekly auto-moderated LFG post on Fridays (We sometimes sticky it, but often times not) - [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/search?q=flair%3ALFG&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)
* Dedicated Reddit HotS Discord - [Link](http://www.discord.gg/heroesofthestorm)
* A LFG Wiki Page - [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/wiki/lookingforgroup)
* And in-game there is an channel - /join Reddit

At a minimum we think we should update the weekly auto-moderated post to include links to these resources and make an effort to prioritize giving the post a sticky, but wonder if the community would like us to do a little more to promote finding people within the range of your rank in Storm League such as coordinating additional in-game channels, Discord chat channels, or something we haven't thought about?

Please let us know your thoughts, we are interested in hearing if we should put some effort into improving our current offerings and coordinating new ones.

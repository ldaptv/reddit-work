# The Basics - Roles: Tanking

Welcome to the new **Weekly Basic's Discussion** where for the next few months there will feature a discussions about [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18/).  These discussions are targeted at those looking to learn or brush up on a roles core principles, common practices, and mistakes to avoid.
  
This week's discussion is on the tank role.  Blizzard defines tanks as "formidable juggernauts the protect their team by absorbing attacks from the enemy and blocking their retreat.  
  
The New Player Guide wiki [**(Link)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/wiki/newplayerguide#wiki_how_to_tank.2C_support_and_dps) features links to tanking articles. We plan to update the section with new content about the role rework at it develops and incorporate feedback from this discussion as well.

  * **Engaging for the team** - Determining when and who to attack  
  * **Peeling/Interrupting for the team** - Protecting the backline from attacks/counterattacks & disrupting channeled abilities
  * **Being a mobile ward or anchor** - Creating vision on areas of the battleground
  * **Being a damage sponge** - Positioning such that enemy damage is focused on the tank  

* **Tanking Videos by */u/UnbiasedBob a.k.a NotParadox*** - Illustrating the four practices:

# The Basics - Roles: Tanks & Tanking

Welcome to the **Weekly Basic's Discussion** where for the next few months there will feature a discussions about [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18/).  These discussions are targeted at those looking to learn or brush up on a roles core principles, common practices, and mistakes to avoid.
  
Last week's **Tank Role Discussion** [**(Link)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/bb5x8f/the_basics_roles_tanking/) outlined the core tanking practices, types of tanks, and tank synergies in Heroes of the Storm.  This week's discussion will close out the topic of tanking with a deep dive reviewing articles about vision, engaging, and shotcalling.
  
* **Back to the Basics: Vision by */u/Moonprayer*** - [**(Link)**](https://tempostorm.com/articles/back-to-the-basics-vision) - Last week's discussion outlined the tanking practice of anchoring and being a mobile ward, this article outlines the basics of vision:

  * **Vision** - Knowing where your opponents are at through the use of abilities and strategic positioning.
  * **Vision control** - Evaluating and putting value on how well you or your team can get the control (just in terms of vision) around an area.
  * **Objective** - Vision over key areas of the battleground enables faster/safer rotations and creates opportunities to interrupt opponent's rotations (usually during objectives)

* **Back to the Basics: Engage by */u/Moonprayer*** - [**(Link)**](https://tempostorm.com/articles/back-to-the-basics-engage) - Last week's discussion outlined the tanking practice of engaging, this article outlines the types of engagements as:

  * **Hard engage / dive** - Easiest to initiate but dependent on how coordinated your team is to follow-up.
  * **Slow engage / poke** - Opposite of dive, if the team composition has heroes with long distant abilities use this form of engage.
  * **Flanking** - Engage a target from multiple angles to divide the opponents defense.  
  * **Counter Engage** - Use hero abilities to isolate an opponent when they begin an engage in order to engage on that target instead.

* **How Engaging Works - Counterplay and Reliability with */u/CavalierGuest*** - [**(Link)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WOx9mIJysw&feature=youtu.be) - Tanks have different types of engagement valued by the capability to be countered and how reliable they are to execute.

* **Education Lounge:Shotcalling with */u/michaeludall /u/CavalierGuest & Heartless*** - [**(Link)**](https://heroeslounge.gg/blog/post/educational-lounge-shotcalling-writeup) - The culmination of all the tanking practices is to make sense of a chaotic environment and create  opportunities to lead through keeping these shotcalling tips in mind:  

  * **Shotcalling** - There are different styles based on the social situation & team structure.
  * **Trust** - It is important to trust the shotcaller even if you disagree, review the call afterwards if needed.
  * **Communication** - Be positive, complement good plays, avoid giving negative feedback during the game, and make good use of Alt+Ping commands.
  * **Step up if no one is going to** - Shotcalling can make a difference, if no one is doing it and you know what to do, give it a try.  

* **The Most Common Shotcalling Mistake with */u/UnbiasedBob a.k.a NotParadox*** - [**(Link)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl_jRh2TGx4) 

  * **The Bystander Effect** - [**(Link)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect)  
  * **Issue** - If others are around people sometimes assume other people will do something that needs to be done.
  * **Shotcaller** - Identifies who on the team should do what and specifically calls out individuals to do it.

Discussion:

* Do you prioritize creating opportunities through vision?
* Do you have any tips for creating opportunities through vision on specific battlegrounds?
* What type of engagements do you favor as a tank or player?
* Do you think Storm League or the ranks in the league favors certain types of engagements?
* Do you value shotcalling in your matches and if no one is shotcalling do you step up?
* Do you have any tips for shotcalling that your find work pretty well?

Please share any questions or opinions you have about tanking with regards to using vision, engaging, or shotcalling.

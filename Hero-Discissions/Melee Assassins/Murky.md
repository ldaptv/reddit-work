# Hero Discussion: Murky
  
Welcome to the **Weekly Hero Discussion** where we feature a rotating hero discussion every week.  This week we are sticking with the 'foolish' theme by feature Murky who recently was classified as a Melee Assassin in the new [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18/). There was a small balance change in January 2019 and Blizzard recently released the [Nerglish Translator](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/22940237/april-fools-nerglish-translator-available-now), we are not sure but it seems to have resulted in Murky's win rate increasing on the HotS ladder significantly.  There was a [Murky Hero Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/977szk/hero_discussion_murky/) on August 14th 2018.

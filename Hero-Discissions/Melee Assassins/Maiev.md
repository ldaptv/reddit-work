# Hero Discussion: Maiev

Welcome to the **Weekly Hero Discussion** where we feature a rotating hero discussion every week.  This week we feature Maiev who recently was classified as a Melee Assassin in the new [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18).  There was a [Maiev Hero Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/86jd1v/hero_discussion_maiev/) on March 23rd 2018.

Maiev was introduced to the Nexus in the Winter of 2018 and quickly rose in popularity in both the HGC and HotS Ladder due to being over tuned.  Since then Maiev has received several balance changes to bring the hero damage and mitigation inline with other Melee Assassins.  Maiev's current win rate on the HotS ladder based on **Heroes Profile** [**(Link)**](https://www.heroesprofile.com/Global/Hero/?timeframe=2.44&type=win_rate&role=Melee+Assassin&hero=&game_type=sl&map=&league_tier=) and **HotsLogs** [**(Link)**](https://www.hotslogs.com/Sitewide/HeroDetails?Hero=Maiev) is about 54% with a popularity around 16%.

# Hero Discussion: Falstad
  
Welcome to the **Weekly Hero Discussion** where we feature a rotating hero discussion every week.  This week we are feature Falstad who recently was classified as a Ranged Assassin in the new [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18/).  Falstad's last balance change in October 2018 resulted in longer cooldowns for his mount ability and level 20 heroic tied to it, yet the heroes popularity and win rate has spiked as of late due to recent tournament performance.  There was a [Falstad Hero Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8y8ywh/hero_discussion_falstad/) on July 12th 2018.

# Hero Discussion: Fenix
  
Welcome to the **Weekly Hero Discussion** where we feature a rotating hero discussion every week.  This week we are feature Fenix who recently was classified as a Ranged Assassin in the new [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18/).  Fenix's last balance change in December 2018 resulted in several buffs to underutilized talents to incentivize a more aggressive play style, recently Fenix is seeing a resurgence on the HotS ladder and is currently the second highest win rate hero.  There was a [Fenix Hero Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8m0fzw/hero_discussion_fenix/) on May 25th 2018.

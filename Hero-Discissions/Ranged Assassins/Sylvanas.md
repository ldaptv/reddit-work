The initial 2018 gameplay tower changes in Heroes of the Storm saw a rise in Sylvanas popularity and win rate that resulted in balance changes to forts and the hero before the 2018 HGC began.  Sylvanas is still among the most popular Specialists in league play on [**Heroes.report**](https://heroes.report/heroes/Sylvanas) and [**HotsLogs**](https://www.hotslogs.com/Sitewide/HeroDetails?Hero=Sylvanas) with a win rate around 50%.  Yet currently in the HGC, the hero is seldom selected.

# Hero Discussion: Abathur Rework
  
Welcome to the **Weekly Hero Discussion** where we feature a rotating hero discussion every week.  This week we feature Abathur, the Utility/Specialist that was recently reworked.  There was a [Abathur Hero Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8axrsc/hero_discussion_abathur/) on April 9th, 2018.  On February 12th, 2019 Abathur received a major rework increasing the heroes popularity and win rate on stats tracking sites.

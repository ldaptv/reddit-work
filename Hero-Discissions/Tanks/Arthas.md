# Hero Discussion: Arthas

Welcome to the **Weekly Hero Discussion** where we feature a rotating hero discussion every week.  This week we feature Arthas who recently was classified as a Tank in the new [Blizzard Roles system](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/blog/22921910/hero-role-expansion-2019-3-18).  There was a [Arthas Hero Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/9axdah/hero_discussion_arthas/) on August 28th 2018.

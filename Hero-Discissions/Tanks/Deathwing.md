Deathwing is one of the most requested heroes for Heroes of the Storm and currently playable as the Bruiser D.Va.  Fans of Deathwing are clamoring for a rework to separate the Mythical character from the current D.Va form.  Deathwing D.Va's current popularity on the ranked ladder based on  **Heroes.report** [**(Link)**](https://heroes.report/heroes/D.Va) and **HotsLogs** [**(Link)**](https://www.hotslogs.com/Sitewide/HeroDetails?Hero=D.Va) is around 5% with a win rate of about 51% over the past seven days.  It is believed when Deathwing is released as a hero, the popularity and win rate will both be close to 100%.

Braxis Holdout entered the Nexus in the Fall of 2016 and reworked in July 2018 to reduce the potential for snowballing by changing how the Zerg waves were accumulated as well as how contention of the control point pads worked.  It is a featured battleground in **HGC Phase 2** [**(Link)**](https://masterleague.net/map/braxis-holdout/).  You can find detailed battleground hero statistics on **Heroes Profile** [**(Link)**](https://www.heroesprofile.com/Global/Hero/?timeframe=10&role=All&hero=All&game_type=tl&map=Braxis%2BHoldout&league_tier=all).
